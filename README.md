## Software Development for Contact Center

The software developed for the Contact Center was made with the purpose of facilitating, 
optimizing and giving a better service to the problems, doubts or complaints received by 
the client, as well as providing the agent of the center with information collected by 
previous calls, a bank of data that provides the possible answers to the problem, a 
system of performance of the same, as well as a system of capture and storage of the 
call which will be processed for its analysis of performance, emotional and capture of 
new problems and solutions for the future consultation to the data bank in the next call, 
all this using tools and services provided by Amazon and Amazon Connect.
